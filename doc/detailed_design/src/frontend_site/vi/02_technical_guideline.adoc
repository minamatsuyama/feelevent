==== Technology topic that you can use but need to be careful 

Technology that you can use if Backward compatible or alternative means is available but need to be careful when implement 

* Data URIs
** http://caniuse.com/#feat=datauri[In IE 10-11,upper limit of data size is 4MB]
//* ::placeholder CSS pseudo-element
//** http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-placeholder[vendor-prefix is neccessary]
* CSS initial value
** http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-initial-value[IE10-11 does not support]
* Promises
** http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises[IE10-11 does not support]
//* rem (root em) units
//** We use font property by shortbanh in IE10, but tt does not work if you want to specify  pseudo-element
* audio, video element
** https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats[media format which is supported in audio and video element of HTML5]
//* pointer-events
//** http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer[Support IE10]
* position:fixed
** There is bug in iOS, Android so we need to fix each time 
* Specify hover of iOS
** When opacity is specified, if you do not tap twice it will not move to the link 

* svg
** Notice when input in <a> tag
*** If you set a link by <a> tag in svg which is embedded in <object> tag, the link is not clickable
//*** For IE9, a pointer does not become a cursor
** If you use display method rather than write svg tag directly, there are times when the color of the rendering fails (become black) if you apply CSS translate for example.
*** Read svg file by JS and embed svg tag

==== Should not use 

* http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-touch-action[CSS touch-action property]
** There is a large difference in behavior depending on device

==== Other
